# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
## Overview of Project
### Purpose
By reviewing and breaking down crowdfunding data of Kickstarter Campaigns, we hope to assist Louise's campaign for her new play, Fever. We analyzed the relationship between the launch date of campaigns and whether or not they succeeded, failed, or were canceled. We also analyzed the percentage of successful, failed, and canceled campaigns to their fundraising goal.  
## Analysis and Challenges
### Analysis of Outcomes Based On Launch Date

First, we studied the theater outcomes based on their launch date. We created a pivot table that showed the number of successful, failed, and canceled campaigns during each month. With this interactive pivot table you are able to review these campaigns depending on which year you want to specify or throughout all of the years given in the Kickstarter data. Then we created a line graph by pulling the information from the pivot table. The line graph is a good, readable visual representation of the data.
