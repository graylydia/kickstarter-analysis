# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
## Overview of Project
### Purpose
By reviewing and breaking down crowdfunding data of Kickstarter Campaigns, we hope to assist Louise's campaign for her new play, Fever. We analyzed the relationship between the launch date of campaigns and whether or not they succeeded, failed, or were canceled. We also analyzed the percentage of successful, failed, and canceled campaigns to their fundraising goal.  
## Analysis and Challenges
### Analysis of Outcomes Based On Launch Date

First, we studied the theater outcomes based on their launch date. We created a pivot table that showed the number of successful, failed, and canceled campaigns during each month. With this interactive pivot table you are able to review these campaigns depending on which year you want to specify or throughout all of the years given in the Kickstarter data. Then we created a line graph by pulling the information from the pivot table. The line graph is a good, readable visual representation of the data. 
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

Second, we considered the percentage of successful, failed, and canceled play campaigns based on their fundraising goal through increments of $5,000. This allowed us to analyze which fundraising goal was being met the most. We created another line graph to represent this data by first creating a table that allowed us to generate the percentages.
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
While interpreting this dataset, I did not encounter any challenges. However, while creating the pivot table inputting the correct fields can be a challenge in itself. You want to make sure that you have the correct fields in the filters, values, columns, and rows so that the table is read correctly. Another challenge that could arise, is inputting the information into the COUNTIFS formula. With this formula, you are many criteria ranges and getting one wrong or mistyping one can produce the wrong data. However, you can check your work and formula by comparing the sum of your data to a COUNTIFS from the original data. 
## Results
One conclusion that we can make from the outcomes based on launch date is that May and June are the best months to launch a theater campaign. In May 111 campaigns and in June 100 campaigns were successful when only 52 and 49 failed during those months. Another conclusion is that the month of December is not a good time to start a theater campaign. In December only 37 campaigns were successful and 35 campaigns were failed. In comparison to the successful and failed campaigns, not many theater campaigns were canceled. 
One assumption that we can make when reviewing the play campaign outcomes based on their fundraising goals is the most successful campaigns were under $5,000. Specifically, 76% of successful play campaigns were under $1,000 and 73% of successful campaigns were within the range of $1,000 and $4,999. 
One limitation of the data from outcomes based by launch date is that we are not isolating the subcategory “plays”. If we were to isolate “plays”, this would give Louise a better understanding of when to launch her play. Additionally, if we added another filter for country Louise would be able to isolate the outcomes by launch date in just the United States since she is interested in launching her play in the United States. Again, I think adding another data point of country in the outcomes based on goals would allow Louise to discern which is a reasonable fundraising goal within the United States. Another limitation we see in the data pulled from outcomes based on goals is that we are not considering the number of donors. For example, 73% of campaigns were successful that ranged from $1,000 to $4,999 but how many donors were there? Who do we need to target for the campaign? Big donors or many small donors?
We could have created a bar graph to visually represent both the outcomes by launch date and outcomes based on goals. If we had created another interactive pivot table for the outcomes based on goals that could’ve been helpful to Louise as well.
